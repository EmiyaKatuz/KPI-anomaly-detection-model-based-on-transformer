## 1. Baseline Model Performance (DCdetector)

The results regarding the local reproduction of the thesis results are shown in the following table.

![Dcdetector result](Baseline_models/KDD2023-DCdetector/img/difference.png)

It can be seen that the local reproduction results are almost identical to those in the paper and that the algorithm performs best on the PSM dataset in aggregate.
